  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section id="Introduction" class="mb-5">
    <h1 class="fw-bold section-title">What Is Nuclear Cybersecurity?</h1>
    <div class="card shadow-sm section-card">
      <div class="card-body fs-5">
        <p>
          Nuclear cybersecurity means keeping the computers and digital tools inside nuclear sites safe.
          These tools measure things like temperature and pressure, and they control pumps and valves.
          If the digital systems are not safe, machines may act incorrectly or stop working.
        </p>

        <p>
          This topic covers simple everyday actions and rules that help keep the facility working normally.
          It is not about complex technical details — it is about practical safety steps that people and teams follow.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this presentation you will learn what needs protection, what can go wrong, and easy ways that sites reduce risk.
          The language is simple so it is easy to remember and explain.
        </p>

  <!-- IMPORTANCE -->
  <section id="Operation" class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="fw-bold section-title">Why It Matters</h2>
    <div class="card shadow-sm section-card mb-3">
      <div class="card-body fs-5">
        <p>
          Nuclear facilities use digital systems for many important tasks. These systems help keep machines working and warn staff when something is wrong.
          When the systems are safe, workers can trust the information they see and act quickly when needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          If someone breaks into these systems or if they stop working, the consequences can go beyond a computer problem.
          Machines may stop, alarms may fail, or readings may show wrong values. That is why protecting these systems is important for safety.
        </p>

        <p>
          Good cybersecurity supports safety, helps avoid mistakes, and makes sure the site can keep working even when small problems appear.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box fs-5 mb-3">
      Even simple actions — like using strong passwords or checking a USB drive — help keep the whole site safer.
    </div>

    <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-3">Systems That Must Be Protected</h4>
    <ul class="list-group shadow-sm mb-4">
      <li class="list-group-item">Sensors — read temperature, pressure, and flow and tell operators what is happening.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Control systems — run pumps, valves, and automatic actions.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Operator screens — show data so workers can make decisions.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Networks — connect machines and allow information to move between systems.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Alarms — alert staff when a value crosses a safe limit.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- RISKS -->
  <section id="Breaches" class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="fw-bold section-title">What Can Go Wrong?</h2>

    <div class="card shadow-sm section-card mb-3">
      <div class="card-body fs-5">
        <p>
          Many problems start from simple everyday things. Below are common risks and a brief example of why they matter.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <ul class="list-group shadow-sm mb-3">
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Outdated software:</strong> older programs may stop receiving safety updates and can fail.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Weak passwords:</strong> easy passwords can be guessed and give others access to important systems.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Unchecked USB devices:</strong> a USB drive can bring in a problem if it is not scanned first.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Poor network separation:</strong> if office computers and control systems are not separated, problems can spread.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Human mistakes:</strong> simple slips or misunderstandings can change settings or miss alarms.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fs-5">
      The good news is most of these risks can be handled by clear rules and small habits that staff follow every day.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- DEFENCE -->
  <section id="Defence" class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="fw-bold section-title">How Facilities Protect Themselves</h2>

    <div class="highlight-box fs-5 mb-3">
      Protection is a combination of easy-to-follow rules, basic tools, and regular checks.
    </div>

    <ul class="list-group shadow-sm mb-4">
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Strong passwords & limited access:</strong> only people who need to use a system have access.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Antivirus & monitoring:</strong> tools that check for problems and alert staff early.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Regular updates and checks:</strong> install updates on time and inspect equipment regularly.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Training for workers:</strong> teach staff safe habits, like checking devices before use.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Network separation:</strong> keep critical systems on their own networks to stop problems from spreading.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Backups and recovery:</strong> have copies of important settings so systems can be restored quickly if needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fs-5">
      These measures are practical and often inexpensive. They work best when everyone follows them every day.
    </p>

  <!-- PRACTICAL EXAMPLES -->
  <section id="Examples" class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="fw-bold section-title">Practical Examples You Can Explain</h2>
    <div class="card shadow-sm section-card mb-3">
      <div class="card-body fs-5">
        <p><strong>Example 1 — USB check:</strong> Before a USB device is used, an operator scans it with a safe computer. If it is clean, it is allowed. This simple step can stop many problems.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 2 — Strong password rule:</strong> Operators use passwords that are hard to guess and change them sometimes. If someone leaves a job, their account is removed quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 3 — Separate networks:</strong> Office computers cannot access the control systems directly. This prevents an office problem from affecting running machines.</p>

          Nuclear cybersecurity is about protecting digital systems that keep facilities safe.
          Most risks come from simple causes like old software, weak passwords, or human mistakes.
          The best protections are simple too: good habits, clear rules, basic tools, and regular checks.
        </p>

        <p>
          By following a few practical steps every day, workers and teams greatly reduce risk.
          This helps keep machines working, keeps people safe, and protects the environment.
